Abstract: <td>
Domain adaptation for machine translation (MT) can be achieved by selecting training instances close to the test set from a larger set of instances. We consider $7$ different domain adaptation strategies and answer $7$ research questions, which give us a recipe for domain adaptation in MT. We perform English to German statistical MT (SMT) experiments in a setting where test and training sentences can come from different corpora and one of our goals is to learn the parameters of the sampling process. Domain adaptation with training instance selection can obtain $22\%$ increase in target $2$-gram recall and can gain up to $3.55$ BLEU points compared with random selection. Domain adaptation with feature decay algorithm (FDA) not only achieves the highest target $2$-gram recall and BLEU performance but also perfectly learns the test sample distribution parameter with correlation $0.99$. Moses SMT systems built with FDA selected 10K training sentences is able to obtain $F_1$ results as good as the baselines that use up to 2M sentences. Moses SMT systems built with FDA selected 50K training sentences is able to obtain 1 $F_1$ point better results than the baselines.</td>

Abstract: <td>
In this paper we describe the use of 	extsc{QuEst}, a framework that aims to obtain predictions on the quality of translations, to improve the performance of machine translation (MT) systems without changing their internal functioning. We apply 	extsc{QuEst} to experiments with: \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.] 

\item multiple system translation ranking, where translations produced by different MT systems are ranked according to their estimated quality, leading to gains of up to $2.72$ BLEU, $3.66$ BLEUs, and $2.17$ $F_1$ points; 

\item n-best list re-ranking, where n-best list translations produced by an MT system are re-ranked based on predicted quality scores to get the best translation ranked top, which lead to improvements on sentence NIST score by $0.41$ points; 

\item n-best list combination, where segments from an n-best list are combined using a lattice-based re-scoring approach that minimize word error, obtaining gains of $0.28$ BLEU points; and 

\item the ITERPE strategy, which attempts to identify translation errors regardless of prediction errors (ITERPE) and build sentence-specific SMT systems (SSSS) on the ITERPE sorted instances identified as having more potential for improvement, achieving gains of up to $1.43$ BLEU, $0.54$ $F_1$, $2.9$ NIST, $0.64$ sentence BLEU, and $4.7$ sentence NIST points in English to German over the top $100$ ITERPE sorted instances. \end{enumerate}</td>

Abstract: <td>
Referential translation machines (RTMs) are a computational model effective at judging monolingual and bilingual similarity while identifying translation acts between any two data sets with respect to interpretants. RTMs pioneer a language-independent approach to all similarity tasks and remove the need to access any task or domain-specific information or resource. We use RTMs for predicting the semantic similarity of text and present state-of-the-art results showing that RTMs can achieve better results on the test set than on the training set. RTMs judge the quality or the semantic similarity of texts by using relevant retrieved training data as interpretants for reaching shared semantics. Interpretants are used to derive features measuring the closeness of the test sentences to the training data, the difficulty of translating them, and the presence of the acts of translation, which may ubiquitously be observed in communication. RTMs achieve top performance at SemEval in various semantic similarity prediction tasks as well as similarity prediction tasks in bilingual settings. We define MAER, mean absolute error relative to the magnitude of the target, and MRAER, mean absolute error relative to the absolute error of a predictor always predicting the target mean assuming that target mean is known. RTM test performance on various tasks sorted according to MRAER can help identify which tasks and subtasks require more work by design.</td>

Abstract: <td>
We introduce FDA5 for efficient parameterization, optimization, and implementation of feature decay algorithms (FDA), a class of instance selection algorithms that use feature decay. FDA increase the diversity of the selected training set by devaluing features (i.e. n-grams) that have already been included. FDA5 decides which instances to select based on three functions used for initializing and decaying feature values and scaling sentence scores controlled with $5$ parameters. We present optimization techniques that allow FDA5 to adapt these functions to in-domain and out-of-domain translation tasks for different language pairs. In a transductive learning setting, selection of training instances relevant to the test set can improve the final translation quality. In machine translation experiments performed on the $2$ million sentence English-German section of the Europarl corpus, we show that a subset of the training set selected by FDA5 can gain up to $3.22$ BLEU points compared to a randomly selected subset of the same size, can gain up to $0.41$ BLEU points compared to using all of the available training data using only $15\%$ of it, and can reach within $0.5$ BLEU points to the full training set result by using only $2.7\%$ of the full training data. FDA5 peaks at around 8M words or $15\%$ of the full training set. In an active learning setting, FDA5 minimizes the human effort by identifying the most informative sentences for translation and FDA gains up to $0.45$ BLEU points using $3/5$ of the available training data compared to using all of it and $1.12$ BLEU points compared to random training set. In translation tasks involving English and Turkish, a morphologically rich language, FDA5 can gain up to $11.52$ BLEU points compared to a randomly selected subset of the same size, can achieve the same BLEU score using as little as $4\%$ of the data compared to random instance selection, and can exceed the full dataset result by $0.78$ BLEU points. FDA5 is able to reduce the time to build a statistical machine translation system to about half with 1M words using only $3\%$ of the space for the phrase table and $8\%$ of the overall space when compared with a baseline system using all of the training data available yet still obtain only $0.58$ BLEU points difference with the baseline system in out-of-domain translation.</td>
