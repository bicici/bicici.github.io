Abstract: <td>
Domain adaptation for machine translation (MT) can be achieved by selecting training instances close to the test set from a larger set of instances. We consider $7$ different domain adaptation strategies and answer $7$ research questions, which give us a recipe for domain adaptation in MT. We perform English to German statistical MT (SMT) experiments in a setting where test and training sentences can come from different corpora and one of our goals is to learn the parameters of the sampling process. Domain adaptation with training instance selection can obtain $22\%$ increase in target $2$-gram recall and can gain up to $3.55$ BLEU points compared with random selection. Domain adaptation with feature decay algorithm (FDA) not only achieves the highest target $2$-gram recall and BLEU performance but also perfectly learns the test sample distribution parameter with correlation $0.99$. Moses SMT systems built with FDA selected 10K training sentences is able to obtain $F_1$ results as good as the baselines that use up to 2M sentences. Moses SMT systems built with FDA selected 50K training sentences is able to obtain 1 $F_1$ point better results than the baselines.</td>

Abstract: <td>
In this paper we describe the use of 	extsc{QuEst}, a framework that aims to obtain predictions on the quality of translations, to improve the performance of machine translation (MT) systems without changing their internal functioning. We apply 	extsc{QuEst} to experiments with: \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.] 

\item multiple system translation ranking, where translations produced by different MT systems are ranked according to their estimated quality, leading to gains of up to $2.72$ BLEU, $3.66$ BLEUs, and $2.17$ $F_1$ points; 

\item n-best list re-ranking, where n-best list translations produced by an MT system are re-ranked based on predicted quality scores to get the best translation ranked top, which lead to improvements on sentence NIST score by $0.41$ points; 

\item n-best list combination, where segments from an n-best list are combined using a lattice-based re-scoring approach that minimize word error, obtaining gains of $0.28$ BLEU points; and 

\item the ITERPE strategy, which attempts to identify translation errors regardless of prediction errors (ITERPE) and build sentence-specific SMT systems (SSSS) on the ITERPE sorted instances identified as having more potential for improvement, achieving gains of up to $1.43$ BLEU, $0.54$ $F_1$, $2.9$ NIST, $0.64$ sentence BLEU, and $4.7$ sentence NIST points in English to German over the top $100$ ITERPE sorted instances. \end{enumerate}</td>

Abstract: <td>
Referential translation machines (RTMs) are a computational model effective at judging monolingual and bilingual similarity while identifying translation acts between any two data sets with respect to interpretants. RTMs pioneer a language-independent approach to all similarity tasks and remove the need to access any task or domain-specific information or resource. We use RTMs for predicting the semantic similarity of text and present state-of-the-art results showing that RTMs can achieve better results on the test set than on the training set. RTMs judge the quality or the semantic similarity of texts by using relevant retrieved training data as interpretants for reaching shared semantics. Interpretants are used to derive features measuring the closeness of the test sentences to the training data, the difficulty of translating them, and the presence of the acts of translation, which may ubiquitously be observed in communication. RTMs achieve top performance at SemEval in various semantic similarity prediction tasks as well as similarity prediction tasks in bilingual settings. We define MAER, mean absolute error relative to the magnitude of the target, and MRAER, mean absolute error relative to the absolute error of a predictor always predicting the target mean assuming that target mean is known. RTM test performance on various tasks sorted according to MRAER can help identify which tasks and subtasks require more work by design.</td>

Abstract: <td>
We introduce FDA5 for efficient parameterization, optimization, and implementation of feature decay algorithms (FDA), a class of instance selection algorithms that use feature decay. FDA increase the diversity of the selected training set by devaluing features (i.e. n-grams) that have already been included. FDA5 decides which instances to select based on three functions used for initializing and decaying feature values and scaling sentence scores controlled with $5$ parameters. We present optimization techniques that allow FDA5 to adapt these functions to in-domain and out-of-domain translation tasks for different language pairs. In a transductive learning setting, selection of training instances relevant to the test set can improve the final translation quality. In machine translation experiments performed on the $2$ million sentence English-German section of the Europarl corpus, we show that a subset of the training set selected by FDA5 can gain up to $3.22$ BLEU points compared to a randomly selected subset of the same size, can gain up to $0.41$ BLEU points compared to using all of the available training data using only $15\%$ of it, and can reach within $0.5$ BLEU points to the full training set result by using only $2.7\%$ of the full training data. FDA5 peaks at around 8M words or $15\%$ of the full training set. In an active learning setting, FDA5 minimizes the human effort by identifying the most informative sentences for translation and FDA gains up to $0.45$ BLEU points using $3/5$ of the available training data compared to using all of it and $1.12$ BLEU points compared to random training set. In translation tasks involving English and Turkish, a morphologically rich language, FDA5 can gain up to $11.52$ BLEU points compared to a randomly selected subset of the same size, can achieve the same BLEU score using as little as $4\%$ of the data compared to random instance selection, and can exceed the full dataset result by $0.78$ BLEU points. FDA5 is able to reduce the time to build a statistical machine translation system to about half with 1M words using only $3\%$ of the space for the phrase table and $8\%$ of the overall space when compared with a baseline system using all of the training data available yet still obtain only $0.58$ BLEU points difference with the baseline system in out-of-domain translation.</td>

Abstract: <td>
We present experiments using quality estimation models to improve the performance of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems by supplementing their training corpora or by building sentence-specific SMT models for instances predicted as having potential for improvement by the ITERPE model. The experiments with quality-informed active learning strategy select, among alternative machine translations, those which are: (i) predicted to have high quality, and thus can be added to the machine translation system training set; (ii) predicted to have low quality, and thus need to be corrected/translated by humans, with the human corrections added to the machine translation system training set. Improvement is measured by the increase in the performance of the overall machine translation systems on held-out datasets, where performance is measured by automatic evaluation metrics comparing the scores of the original machine translation system against the score of the improved machine translation system after additional material is used. The experiments with ITERPE consist in automatically grouping translation instances into different quality bands, for instance for re-translation or for post-editing [Bicici and Specia, 2014]. This method can be helpful in automatic identification of quality barriers in MT to achieve high quality machine translation.</td>

Abstract: <td>
We develop a top performing model for automatic, accurate, and language independent prediction of sentence-level statistical machine translation (SMT) quality with or without looking at the translation outputs. We derive various feature functions measuring the closeness of a given test sentence to the training data and the difficulty of translating the sentence. We describe 	exttt{mono} feature functions that are based on statistics of only one side of the parallel training corpora and 	exttt{duo} feature functions that incorporate statistics involving both source and target sides of the training data. Overall, we describe novel, language independent, and SMT system extrinsic features for predicting the SMT performance, which also rank high during feature ranking evaluations. 

We experiment with different learning settings, with or without looking at the translations, which help differentiate the contribution of different feature sets. We apply partial least squares and feature subset selection, both of which improve the results and we present ranking of the top features selected for each learning setting, providing an exhaustive analysis of the extrinsic features used. We show that by just looking at the test source sentences and not using the translation outputs at all, we can achieve better performance than a baseline system using SMT model dependent features that generated the translations. Furthermore, our prediction system is able to achieve the $2$nd best performance overall according to the official results of the Quality Estimation Task (QET) challenge when also looking at the translation outputs. Our representation and features achieve the top performance in QET among the models using the SVR learning model.</td>

Abstract: <td>
We use feature decay algorithms (FDA) for fast deployment of accurate statistical machine translation systems taking only about half a day for each translation direction. We develop parallel FDA for solving computational scalability problems caused by the abundance of training data for SMT models and language models and still achieve SMT performance that is on par with using all of the training data or better. Parallel FDA runs separate FDA models on randomized subsets of the training data and combines the instance selections later. Parallel FDA can also be used for selecting the LM corpus based on the training set selected by parallel FDA. The high quality of the selected training data allows us to obtain very accurate translation outputs close to the top performing SMT systems. The relevancy of the selected LM corpus can reach up to $86\%$ reduction in the number of OOV tokens and up to $74\%$ reduction in the perplexity. We perform SMT experiments in all language pairs in the WMT13 translation task and obtain SMT performance close to the top systems using significantly less resources for training and development.</td>

Abstract: <td>
We introduce referential translation machines (RTM) for quality estimation of translation outputs. RTMs are a computational model for identifying the translation acts between any two data sets with respect to a reference corpus selected in the same domain, which can be used for estimating the quality of translation outputs, judging the semantic similarity between text, and evaluating the quality of student answers. RTMs achieve top performance in automatic, accurate, and language independent prediction of sentence-level and word-level statistical machine translation (SMT) quality. RTMs remove the need to access any SMT system specific information or prior knowledge of the training data or models used when generating the translations. We develop novel techniques for solving all subtasks in the WMT13 quality estimation (QE) task (QET 2013) based on individual RTM models. Our results achieve improvements over last year's QE task results (QET 2012), as well as our previous results, provide new features and techniques for QE, and rank $1$st or $2$nd in all of the subtasks.</td>

Abstract: <td>
The aim of this report is to define the interfaces for the tools used in the MT development and evaluation scenarios as included in the QTLaunchPad (QTLP) infrastructure. Specification of the interfaces is important for the interaction and interoperability of the tools in the developed QTLP infrastructure. In addressing this aim, the report provides: 1. Descriptions of the common aspects of the tools and their standardized data formatsÍ¾ 2. Descriptions of the interfaces for the tools for interoperability. where the tools are categorized into preparation, development, and evaluation categories including the human interfaces for quality assessment with multidimensional quality metrics. Interface specifications allow a modular tool infrastructure, flexibly selecting among alternative implementations, enabling realistic expectations to be made at different sections of the QTLP information flow pipeline, and supporting the QTLP infrastructure. D3.2.1 allows the emergence of the QTLP infrastructure and helps the identification and acquisition of existing tools (D4.4.1), the integration of identified language processing tools (D3.3.1), their implementation (D3.4.1), and their testing (D3.5.1). QTLP infrastructure will facilitate the organization and running of the quality translation shared task (D5.2.1). We also provide human interfaces for translation quality assessment with the multidimensional quality metrics (D1.1.1). D3.2.1 is a living document until M12, which is when the identification and acquisition of existing tools (D4.4.1) and the implementation of identified language processing tools (D3.4.1) are due.</td>

Abstract: <td>
Machine translation is the task of automatically finding the translation of a source sentence in the target language. Statistical machine translation (SMT) use parallel corpora or bilingual paired corpora that are known to be translations of each other to find a likely translation for a given source sentence based on the observed translations. The task of machine translation can be seen as an instance of estimating the functions that map strings to strings. 

Regression based machine translation (RegMT) approach provides a learning framework for machine translation, separating learning models for training, training instance selection, feature representation, and decoding. We use the transductive learning framework for making the RegMT approach computationally more scalable and consider the model building step independently for each test sentence. We develop training instance selection algorithms that not only make RegMT computationally more scalable but also improve the performance of standard SMT systems. We develop better training instance selection techniques than previous work from given parallel training sentences for achieving more accurate RegMT models using less training instances. 

We introduce L1 regularized regression as a better model than L2 regularized regression for statistical machine translation. Our results demonstrate that sparse regression models are better than L2 regularized regression for statistical machine translation in predicting target features, estimating word alignments, creating phrase tables, and generating translation outputs. We develop good evaluation techniques for measuring the performance of the RegMT model and the quality of the translations. We use F1 measure, which performs good when evaluating translations into English according to human judgments. F1 allows us to evaluate the performance of the RegMT models using the target feature prediction vectors or the coefficients matrices learned or a given SMT model using its phrase table without performing the decoding step, which can be computationally expensive. 

Decoding is dependent on the representation of the training set and the features used. We use graph decoding on the prediction vectors represented in $n$-gram or word sequence counts space found in the training set. We also decode using Moses after transforming the learned weight matrix representing the mappings between the source and target features to a phrase table that can be used by Moses during decoding. We demonstrate that sparse L1 regularized regression performs better than L2 regularized regression in the German-English translation task and in the Spanish-English translation task when using small sized training sets. Graph based decoding can provide an alternative to phrase-based decoding in translation domains having low vocabulary.</td>

Abstract: <td>
We present an empirical study of instance selection techniques for machine translation. In an active learning setting, instance selection minimizes the human effort by identifying the most informative sentences for translation. In a transductive learning setting, selection of training instances relevant to the test set improves the final translation quality. After reviewing the state of the art in the field, we generalize the main ideas in a class of instance selection algorithms that use feature decay. Feature decay algorithms increase diversity of the training set by devaluing features that are already included. We show that the feature decay rate has a very strong effect on the final translation quality whereas the initial feature values, inclusion of higher order features, or sentence length normalizations do not. We evaluate the best instance selection methods using a standard Moses baseline using the whole 1.6 million sentence English-German section of the Europarl corpus. We show that selecting the best 3000 training sentences for a specific test sentence is sufficient to obtain a score within 1 BLEU of the baseline, using 5\% of the training data is sufficient to exceed the baseline, and a ~2 BLEU improvement over the baseline is possible by optimally selected subset of the training data. In out-of-domain translation, we are able to reduce the training set size to about 7\% and achieve a similar performance with the baseline.</td>

Abstract: <td>
We experiment with splitting words into their stem and suffix components for modeling morphologically rich languages. We show that using a morphological analyzer and disambiguator results in a significant perplexity reduction in Turkish. We present flexible n-gram models, FlexGrams, which assume that the n-1 tokens that determine the probability of a given token can be chosen anywhere in the sentence rather than the preceding n-1 positions. Our final model achieves 27\% perplexity reduction compared to the standard n-gram model.</td>

Abstract: <td>
This paper presents approaches for building, managing, and evaluating consensus ontologies from the individual ontologies of a network of socially interacting agents. Each agent has its own conceptualization of the world within the multiagent system framework. The interactions between agents are modeled by sending queries and receiving responses and later assessing each other's performance based on the results. This model enables us to measure the \emph{quality} of the societal beliefs in the resources which we represent as the \emph{expertise} in each domain. The dynamic nature of our system allows us to model the emergence of consensus that mimics the evolution of language. We present an algorithm for generating the consensus ontologies which makes use of the authoritative agent's conceptualization in a given domain. As the expertise of agents changes after a number of interactions, the consensus ontology that we build based on the agents' individual views evolves. The resulting approach is concordant with the principles of emergent semantics. We provide formal definitions for the problem of finding a consensus ontology in a step by step manner. We evaluate the consensus ontologies by using different heuristic measures of similarity based on the component ontologies. Conceptual processing methods for generating, manipulating, and evaluating consensus ontologies are given and experimental results are presented. The presented approach looks promising and opens new directions for further research.</td>

This paper presents a language-independent context-based sentence alignment technique given parallel corpora. We can view the problem of aligning sentences as finding translations of sentences chosen from different sources. Unlike current approaches which rely on pre-defined features and models, our algorithm employs features derived from the distributional properties of words and does not use any language dependent knowledge. We make use of the context of sentences and the notion of Zipfian word vectors which effectively models the distributional properties of words in a given sentence. We accept the context to be the frame in which the reasoning about sentence alignment is done. We evaluate the performance of our system based on two different measures: sentence alignment accuracy and sentence alignment coverage. We compare the performance of our system with commonly used sentence alignment systems and show that our system performs 1.2149 to 1.6022 times better in reducing the error rate in alignment accuracy and coverage for moderately sized corpora.</td>

Abstract: <td>
Professional translators of technical documents often use Translation Memory (TM) systems in order to capitalize on the repetitions frequently observed in these documents. TM systems typically exploit not only complete matches between the source sentence to be translated and some previously translated sentence, but also so-called \emph{fuzzy matches}, where the source sentence has some substantial commonality with a previously translated sentence. These fuzzy matches can be very worthwhile as a starting point for the human translator, but the translator then needs to manually edit the associated TM-based translation to accommodate the differences with the source sentence to be translated. If part of this process could be automated, the cost of human translation could be significantly reduced. The paper proposes to perform this automation in the following way: a phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system (trained on a bilingual corpus in the same domain as the TM) is combined with the TM fuzzy match, by extracting from the fuzzy-match a large (possibly gapped) bi-phrase that is dynamically added to the usual set of ''static'' bi-phrases used for decoding the source. We report experiments that show significant improvements in terms of BLEU and NIST scores over both the translations produced by the stand-alone SMT system and the fuzzy-match translations proposed by the stand-alone TM system.</td>

Abstract: <td>
Density based clustering methods allow the identification of arbitrary, not necessarily convex regions of data points that are densely populated. The number of clusters does not need to be specified beforehand; a cluster is defined to be a connected region that exceeds a given density threshold. This paper introduces the notion of local scaling in density based clustering, which determines the density threshold based on the local statistics of the data. The local maxima of density are discovered using a k-nearest-neighbor density estimation and used as centers of potential clusters. Each cluster is grown until the density falls below a pre-specified ratio of the center point's density. The resulting clustering technique is able to identify clusters of arbitrary shape on noisy backgrounds that contain significant density gradients. The focus of this paper is to automate the process of clustering by making use of the local density information for arbitrarily sized, shaped, located, and numbered clusters. The performance of the new algorithm is promising as it is demonstrated on a number of synthetic datasets and images for a wide range of its parameters.</td>

This paper describes an analysis tool for dynamic gaming environments. It is based on an image processing system and a contingency analysis tool for extracting the rules that the user is applying in a driving game simulation. The tool is intended for a cognitive modelling architecture that will learn from the user's previous actions to minimize the amount of assumptions made to control the environment. Interaction with the dynamically changing visual environments at real-time is important. This paper discusses our initial attempt to analyze dynamic gaming environments through statistical measures, our learning goal from previous experiences, the limitations, and its implications for user interface environments that dynamically change.</td>

Abstract: <td>
Human-computer interaction experiences unbalanced talents of counterparts in the user interface, which can only be eased with the introduction of new solutions. Commonsense reasoning is a promising answer that offers formalization and computational models about how humans reason and think in a sensible way. In user interface design, assumed conventions and rules are widely followed and carried to user interfaces. For the most part, these assumptions are obvious to humans yet incomprehensible to computers. As a result, it is essential that tools are developed, capable of retrieving relevant, sensible inferences that in turn can serve as catalysts for future reasoning. Embedding this tool in user interfaces can provide many benefits including representation of assumptions and unspoken rules, the addition of useful tool abilities, and increasingly usable and accessible environments where computers and humans have extended communication capabilities to assist in understanding each other. In this article, we present groundwork for applying commonsense reasoning to user interfaces. We start with identifying the asymmetry in human-machine communication and later focus on some approaches such as softbots and the proposed anti-mac interface. Then we identify the problems faced in user interfaces such as the correspondence problem inherited from computer vision. Next, we state our research ambition as adding commonsense reasoning functionality to user interfaces and further survey previous approaches and the state of the art. We depict the big picture we are facing and list some of the rewards to be earned by applying this technique. Later, characteristics of common sense are investigated together with examples in first-order logic. We then report various lessons learned from earlier attempts that began in physical systems concentrated on small microworld problems. Finally, we cite a sample methodology for automating commonsense reasoning and identify a number of questions that have yet to be answered.</td>
